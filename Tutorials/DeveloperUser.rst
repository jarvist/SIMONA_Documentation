Developer Documentation
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Developer documentation is oriented to the development of new force field terms that could
be used in a custom SIMONA simulation. 

Source code of SIMONA is based on XML, Python and C++ languages and a basic requirement
is to use the source code of SIMONA for further recompilations.

The developer documentation is available at compiling the source code activating the flag
``DO_DOCU = False`` in the ``Sconstruct`` file in the main directory of SIMONA directory.
