==================================

.. caution::
   Documentation is in construction.

**Simulation of Molecular and Nanoscale Systems (SIMONA)** is a generalized simulation 
kernel and a specific simulation pre-processor, which enables rapid prototyping of 
forcefields and simulation methods for efficient Monte Carlo simulations. It is 
written in a modular manner to allow efficient code reuse for both the developer 
and the user of the program.
